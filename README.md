Coding Challenge To DragonFruit AI 

1) Images 
PNG format storage - Keeps image intact even after compression + compact in nature
Bytes Storage = (dimensions * bytes/pixel) = 10 ^ 10 Bytes 

2) In notebook

3) In notebook

4) In notebook

5) PNG compression - runtime for a single image is 351 seconds. (see notebook for implementation)

6) I used resources like Claude and ChatGPT to debug and gain some ideas as to how to progress with coding. It served as a companion for me to talk with and bounce ideas off.
